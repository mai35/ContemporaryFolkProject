            <h2>About our Project</h2>
            <p>For our project, we decided to focus on the period of the second folk revival from around the 1960s on hwere there were large 
            musical, political, social, and counterculture changes. We looked at songs from US artists such as Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, etc. and compared the 
            folk revival in the US to parallels in the other countries and languages we worked with, which includes Spanish, Italian, and Japanese.</p>
            <p>We were interested in seeing the global trend in contemporary folk music by comparing and contrasting the themes that are present in the songs. 
            The three themes we chose to focus on were political, regional, and social themes. Within the song lyrics we looked at nouns and marked up subthemes
            if there were any referenced by the nouns, and related those subthemes that were present to the overarching themes of the  songs.</p> 
            <p>We believe that our research falls within sociolinguistics and we are hoping that the results of our research show some implications of similarities
            in cross-cultural social states within the timeframe of 1960s to the present.</p>
