            <h2>About our Project</h2>
            <h3>How did we choose our topic?</h3>
            <p>When we were told to chose a topic to research we had actually started with different
                topics. This semester has been the song lyrics semester. As a group we knew we
                wanted to investigate a musical topic. Originally, I (Taylor) was curious about
                wartime songs, a lot of which are folk songs, and their themes. Interestingly, the
                week before we had to decide on a project topic Mako had been listening to some
                Japanese folk songs with her parents.</p>
            <p> When there was a folk song revival in the United States there was a parallel
                movement in Japan, according to her parents. It lead us to seek out whether or not
                something similar happened in other countries. Since Mako also speaks Italian and
                knew a few Italian folk songs, we decided to look at Italy as well. I (Taylor) speak
                Spanish as well so there we had our languages: English, Japanese, Italian, and
                Spanish.</p>
            <h3>What is our focus?</h3>
            <p>For our project, we decided to focus on the period of the second folk revival from
                around the 1960s on where there were large musical, political, social, and
                counterculture changes. We looked at songs from US artists such as Pete Seeger, Bob
                Dylan, etc. and compared the folk revival in the US and other English speaking
                countries to parallels in the other countries and languages we worked with, which
                includes Spanish, Italian, and Japanese.</p>
            <p>We were interested in seeing the global trend in contemporary folk music by comparing
                and contrasting the themes that are present in the songs. The three themes we chose
                to focus on were political, regional, and social themes. Within the song lyrics we
                looked at nouns and marked up subthemes if there were any referenced by the nouns,
                and related those subthemes that were present to the overarching themes of the
                songs.</p>
            <h3>Why did we choose this topic?</h3>
            <p>As linguistic majors we knew we wanted to have a topic that would be of interest to
                linguists. We believe that our research falls within sociolinguistics and we are
                hoping that the results of our research show some implications of similarities in
                cross-cultural social states within the timeframe of 1960s to the present.</p>
