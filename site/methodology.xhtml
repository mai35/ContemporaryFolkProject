            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>How did we tag our songs?</h3>
            <p>Firstly, since we're looking at songs it was important to maintain a specific
                structure throughout. Our schema started out with simply the structure tags and
                elements. We had chosen a total of ten songs for each language so our xml documents
                contained the songs that were were grouped according to what language they were. </p>
            <p>As we looked at each individual song within our xml documents tags such as meta and
                lyrics, were the first important structure tags. We knew we needed to look at
                information about each of the songs as well as the lyrics themselves.</p>
            <p> Within the meta element we had elements such as country, language, title, artist, dialect, and most
                importantly theme.--since not all of our songs within
                languages were from the same country--</p>
