            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>How did we tag our songs?</h3>
            <p>First, since we were looking at songs, it was important to maintain a specific
                structure throughout our corpus. Our schema started out with just the structure tags and
                elements. We had chosen a total of ten songs for each language so our XML documents
                contained the songs that were grouped according to what language they were. </p>
            <p>As we looked at each individual song within our XML documents, tags such as meta and
                lyrics were the first important structure tags to group different kinds of information. 
                We knew we needed to look at descriptive information about each of the songs as well as 
                the lyrics themselves.</p>
            <p> Within the meta element we had elements such as country, language, title, artist,
                year, dialect, and most importantly theme. Since not all of our songs within
                languages were from the same country, country could be a useful element for later
                analysis. Language was a more important element for our research. However, dialect within a language was not
                as important an element as we originally thought since it seems to be prevalent only in
                Italian folk songs. We chose to include the song title and
                artist name in order to differentiate both within our song collection and between
                the original version and any remakes that have been produced of the song. We chose
                year as another element to note because we were looking at a specific
                timeframe, from the 1960s to the present.</p>
            <p>Within each individual song we had a tag for lyrics that came after our metadata
                header. Within the lyrics tag we had stanza, line, and noun elements. Our stanza element had
                a type attribute to distinguish verses, chorus, and bridges because we thought it may help
                our analysis. However, we did not end up using the distinction for analysis within the time frame 
                of this semester. Line elements had no attributes and were included simply to maintain 
                lyrical structure that most songs have when they are written down. Our noun tags were our most
                important tags.</p>
            <p>Since our research question has to do with themes, we decided that a lot of themes can be
                determined based on word choice. More specifically, nouns tend to show or at least hint
                at the overall theme of a song. Therefore, we decided to look at all of the nouns,
                pronouns included. Within our noun elements we had the
                following attributes: typeN, cat, ref, foreign, subtheme. The typeN attribute was
                used to differentiate between pronouns, proper nouns and common nouns. The cat
                attribute denoted whether the noun was a person, place, thing or idea. The ref attribute was
                mainly used for pronouns that referred to a previous noun. The foreign attribute
                was used to determine whether or not the word was from another language or not since borrowing occurs in many languages.</p>
            <p>The most imporant attribute for our analysis was the subtheme attribute.
                Unlike our theme element that was chosen amongst specific predetermined themes, we allowed for our subthemes
                to be more specific and determined by the context of the noun. The noun itself, regardless of the context of the whole song,
                has its own subthematic meaning. Not all of the nouns in our songs had a subtheme attribute, but there were a substantial
                number that were marked up in our corpus. </p>
