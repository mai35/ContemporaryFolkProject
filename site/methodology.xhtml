            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <h3>How did we tag our songs?</h3>
            <p>Firstly, since we're looking at songs it was important to maintain a specific
                structure throughout. Our schema started out with simply the structure tags and
                elements. We had chosen a total of ten songs for each language so our xml documents
                contained the songs that were were grouped according to what language they were. </p>
            <p>As we looked at each individual song within our xml documents tags such as meta and
                lyrics, were the first important structure tags. We knew we needed to look at
                information about each of the songs as well as the lyrics themselves.</p>
            <p> Within the meta element we had elements such as country, language, title, artist,
                year, dialect, and most importantly theme. Since not all of our songs within
                languages were from the same country, country could be a useful element for later
                analysis. Language, however, is probably a more important element. Dialect was not
                as important an element as we originally thought since it seems to be only an
                Italian folk song differentiation. Obviously, we chose to include the song title and
                artist name in order to differentiate both within our song collection and between
                the original version and any remakes that have been produced of the song. We chose
                year as another element because we were looking at a specific, if not broad,
                timeframe. It was necessary that all of our song chioces were produced or recorded
                after 1960.</p>
            <p>Within each individual song we had a tag for lyrics that came after our meta tag
                header. Within the lyrics tag we had stanza, line, and noun. Our stanza element had
                a type attribute. Originally we thought that it would be important to differentiate
                between the different types of stanza like verse, chorus, or bridge. However in this
                semester project we did not end up using the distinction for analysis. Line elements
                had no attributes and were simply to maintain normal lyrical structure that most
                songs have when they are written down. Our noun tags were probably our most
                important information tags.</p>
            <p>Since our research question has to do with themes we decided that a lot of themes are
                evident based on word choice. More specifically nouns tend to show or at least hint
                at the overall theme of a song. Therefore we decided to look at all of the nouns,
                pronouns included, to see if there was an overall hint to whether or not nouns were
                that definitive in showing song themes. Within our noun elements we had the
                following attributes: typeN, cat, ref, foreign, subtheme. The typeN attricute was
                used to differentiate between pronouns, proper nouns and common nouns. The cat
                attricute was whether it was a person, place, thing or idea. The ref attribute was
                mainly used for pronouns that might refer to a previous noun. The foreign attribute
                was whether or not the word was from another language or not since borrowing does
                seem to occur in most languages. And then the most imporant attribute for our
                analysis was the subtheme attribute.</p>
            <p>Unlike our theme element that had specific prechosen themes we tagged our subthemes
                separately. It is unclear if having done that was a good or a bad idea but it was
                the way we decided to do it. Our subthemes had more to do with an individual word,
                the noun, than anything overall. The noun itself regardless of context of the song
                has its own subtheme. Not all of the nouns in our songs had a subtheme attribute but
                the ones that did were marked. </p>
