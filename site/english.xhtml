               They paved paradise<br />
               And put up a parking lot<br />
               With a pink hotel *, a boutique<br />
               And a swinging hot spot<br />
               <br />

               Put 'em in a tree museum *<br />
               And they charged the people<br />
               A dollar and a half just to see 'em <br />
               <br />

               Hey farmer farmer <br />
               Put away that DDT * now<br />
               Give me spots on my apples <br />
               But leave me the birds and the bees<br />
               Please! <br />

               Late last night<br />
               I heard the screen door slam<br />
               And a big yellow taxi<br />
               Took away my old man<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Don't it always seem to go<br />

               Till it's gone <br />
               They paved paradise <br />
               And put up a parking lot<br />

            <p>
               
               I don't know if you can see<br />
               The changes that have come over me.<br />
               In these last few days I've been afraid<br />
               That I might drift away<br />
               So I've been telling old stories, singing songs<br />
               That make me think about where I came from<br />
               And that's the reason why I seem<br />
               So far away today<br />
               <br />
               
               Oh, but let me tell you that I love you<br />
               That I think about you all the time<br />
               Caledonia you're calling me<br />
               And now I'm going home<br />
               If I should become a stranger<br />
               You know that it would make me more than sad<br />
               Caledonia's been everything<br />
               I've ever had<br />
               <br />
               
               Now I have moved and I've kept on moving<br />
               Proved the points that I needed proving<br />
               Lost the friends that I needed losing<br />
               Found others on the way<br />
               I have kissed the ladies and left them crying<br />
               Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying<br />
               I have traveled hard with coattails flying<br />
               Somewhere in the wind<br />
               <br />
               
               Oh, but let me tell you that I love you<br />
               That I think about you all the time<br />
               Caledonia you're calling me<br />
               And now I'm going home<br />

               Caledonia's been everything<br />
               I've ever had<br />
               <br />
               
               Now I'm sitting here before the fire<br />
               The empty room, the forest choir<br />
               The flames that could not get any higher<br />
               They've withered now they've gone<br />
               But I'm steady thinking my way is clear<br />
               And I know what I will do tomorrow<br />
               When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow<br />
               Then I will disappear<br />
               <br />
               
               Oh, but let me tell you that I love you<br />

               Ridin' on the city of New Orleans<br />
               Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail;<br />
               Fourteen cars and fourteen restless riders,<br />
               Three conductors, twenty five sacks of mail.<br />
               All along the southbound odyssey,<br />
               the train rolls out of Kankakee<br />
               Ridin' past the houses, farms and fields,<br />
               Passin' trains that have no names,<br />
               freight yards full of old black men,<br />
               The graveyards of the rusted automobiles.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Good mornin' America, how are you?<br />
               Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son.<br />
               I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans.<br />
               I'll be gone five hundred miles 'fore the day is done.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car,<br />
               Penny a point, ain't no-one keepin' score.<br />
                Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle,<br />
               Feel the wheels a-rumblin' 'neath the floor.<br />
               And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers<br />
               Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel;<br />
               Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat,<br />
               And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Good mornin' America, how are you?<br />

               Nighttime on the city of New Orleans,<br />
               Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee.<br />
               Halfway home, we'll be there 'fore mornin',<br />
               Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea.<br />
                And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream,<br />
               And the steel wheels still ain't heard the news,<br />
               The conductor sings his songs again,<br />
               the passengers will please refrain,<br />
               This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues.<br />

            <p>
               
               In the early mornin' rain<br />
               With a dollar in my hand<br />
               And an aching in my heart<br />
               And my pockets full of sand<br />
               I'm a long ways from home<br />
               And I missed my loved one so<br />
               In the early mornin' rain<br />
               With no place to go<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Out on runway number nine<br />
               Big seven o seven set to go<br />
               Well I'm out here on the grass<br />
               Where the pavement never grows<br />
               Where the liquor tasted good<br />
               And the women all were fast<br />
               There she goes my friend<br />
               She's rolling out at last<br />
               <br />
               
               
               Hear the mighty engines roar<br />
               See the silver wing on high<br />
               She's away and westward bound<br />
               For above the clouds she flies<br />
               Where the mornin' rain don't fall<br />
               And the sun always shines<br />
               She'll be flying over my home<br />
               In about three hours time<br />
               <br />
               
               
               This ol' airport's got me down<br />
               It's no earthly good to me<br />
               Cause I'm stuck here on the ground<br />
               Cold and drunk as I might be<br />
               Can't jump a jet plane<br />
               Like you can a freight train<br />
               So I best be on my way<br />
               In the early mornin' rain<br />
               So I best be on my way<br />

               Kicking up the paper,<br />
               with his worn out shoes? <br />
               In his eyes you see no pride <br />
               Hand held loosely at his side<br />
               Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news <br />
               <br />
               
               
               So how can you tell me you're lonely,<br />
               And say for you that the sun don't shine?<br />
               Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London <br />
               I'll show you something to make you change your mind<br />

               Have you seen the old girl <br />
               Who walks the streets of London <br />
               Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?<br />
                She's no time for talking,<br />
               She just keeps right on walking <br />
               Carrying her home in two carrier bags.<br />
               <br />

               At a quarter past eleven,<br />
               Same old man is sitting there on his own<br />
               Looking at the world<br />
               Over the rim of his tea-cup,<br />
               Each tea last an hour<br />
               Then he wanders home alone<br />

               Outside the seaman's mission<br />
               Memory fading with<br />
               The medal ribbons that he wears.<br />
               In our winter city,<br />
               The rain cries a little pity<br />
               For one more forgotten hero <br />
               And a world that doesn't care<br />
               <br />

            <p>
               
               Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river,<br />
               You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her,<br />
               And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you wanna be there,<br />
               And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China,<br />
               And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,<br />
               Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer,<br />
               That you've always been her lover.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               And you want to travel with her,<br />
               And you want to travel blind,<br />
               And you know that she will trust you,<br />
               For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water,<br />
               And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower,<br />
               And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him,<br />
               He said "all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them,"<br />
               But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open<br />
               Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               And you want to travel with him,<br />
               And you want to travel blind,<br />
               And you think maybe you'll trust him,<br />
               For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.<br />

               Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,<br />
               She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,<br />
               And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor,<br />
               And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,<br />
               There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,<br />
               They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,<br />
               While Suzanne holds the mirror.<br />
               <br />
               
               
               And you want to travel with her,<br />
               And you want to travel blind,<br />
               And you know that you can trust her,<br />
