            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Use these links to check out the analysis and components for analysis that we devised
                from our data! Each link provides a page with the corresponding analysis and
                descriptions detailing its use and importance in relation to our research question.<br /><br />
                <a href="themeCount.xhtml">Theme Count Bar Graph</a><br />
                <a href="newSubthemeTable.xhtml">Table of Nouns with Subthemes</a></p>
            <p>Below is our analysis write up. It includes some of the results we found from our
                data. Since we used such a small sample there is no real way to make definite
                conclusions. With that said, we did find some trends that we'd like to discuss. Even
                if our sample size does not show great evidence it is sill possible that it could
                lead to further investigations. </p>
            <p>You can see our break down of songs by theme. We have displayed them by language as
                well becuase that was the purpose of our analysis. You can reach that page by
                clicking <a href="themeCount.xhtml">here</a> or on the link near the top of this
                page.Because of the limited size of the data we could not produce any significant
                results but there seems to be a correlation between politically themed songs in
                English and Spanish. In almost all of the cases for political, political social, and
                political regional, the only songs with these themes were English and Spanish (with
                the exception of political social which had just 2 Italian songs and 1 Japanese
                song). It is entirely possibly that this was skewed by the songs that we chose.
                Since we did not scientifically pick our songs there is bound to be some bias when
                it come to chosing songs. Or simply there is the fact that since both the Spanish
                and English song choices came from all different countries that it was more likely
                that there'd be more political songs available. Most countries have artists that
                produce at least one song that has political conotations. Therefore since the
                Spanish and English songs were chosen from multiple countries while the Japanese and
                Italian songs were from one single contry each that this affected our data. It
                possible that it would have been a better option to choose songs from one country
                and done it by country instead of by language. Languages like Spanish and English
                that are not singular to one country and one culture would definitely different than
                languages that are related to one culture and country. It is also possible that the
                song preferrences of the person that chose the songs affected the output of this
                table. Human bias is a huge issue that can affect any part of the results that were
                found.</p>
            <p>We also looked at subthemes but chose to use a table instead of a bar chart like with
                the overall song themes. You can reach that page by clicking <a
                    href="newSubthemeTable.xhtml">here</a> or by clicking the link near the top of
                this page.This table shows a number of things. Again these results are not
                conclusive of anything because we did not have enough data to analyze. However one
                interesting and probably obvious to most people is that when there were a lot of
                culturally themed nouns in a song the song seems to most likely be a socially themed
                song. Another idea that this table shows about these songs is that politically
                themed songs have a lot of instances of war themed nouns or just politically themed
                nouns. Religiously themed nouns seem to occur in all different kinds of themes. Of
                the three basic concepts politcal, social, and regional, a religiously themed noun
                seems to occur in each of those themed songs. Nouns that had a love theme seemed to
                occur more in politically social themed songs than in just social songs. This is an
                interesting idea and it would be interesting to see if this was a fact or if this
                result was affected by the song choices. This is even less telling of trends than
                the bar chart because not all of the songs had nouns that had subthemes even though
                they had overall themes as songs themselves.</p>
            <p>Since this is such a small data set there is plenty of further work that could be
                done. It is unethically to make conclusions based on the results found here and this
                is really only a stepping stone for further research. </p>
