            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Use these links to check out the analysis and components for analysis that we devised
                from our data! Each link provides a page with the corresponding analysis and
                descriptions detailing its use and importance in relation to our research question.<br /><br />

            <p>Below is our analysis write up, it includes some of the results we found from our
                data. Since we used such a small sample we utilized a descriptive approach to our analysis 
                based solely on our corpus, and not a projective one since we cannot make any generalized
                conclusions. With that said, we did find some trends that we would like to discuss. Even
                if our sample size does not show great evidence of any particular trend at this point, we are 
                hopeful that it can lead to further investigations in the future. </p>
            <p>With our theme count bar graph analysis, you can see our break down of songs by theme. We have displayed the results by language as
                well as a part of our analysis for our original research question. You can reach that page by
                clicking <a href="themeCount.xhtml">here</a> or on the link near the top of this
                page. Because of the limited size of the data, we could not produce any significant
                results. However, there seems to be a correlation between politically themed songs in
                English and Spanish. In almost all of the cases for political, political social, and
                political regional, the only songs with these themes were English and Spanish (with
                the exception of political social which had just 2 Italian songs and 1 Japanese
                song). It is entirely possibly that this was skewed by the songs that we chose.
                Since we did not scientifically pick our songs, there is bound to be some bias when
                it come to the songs we chose. It could also be the case that since both the Spanish
                and English songs came from different countries as opposed to Japanese and Italian songs, it was more likely
                that there would be more political songs available. Most countries have artists that
                produce at least one song that has political conotations. Looking back, it is
                possible that it would have been a better decision to choose songs from one country
                and analyze our research by country instead of by language. Languages like Spanish and English
                that are not singular to one country and one culture can definitely be different than
                languages that are mainly related to one culture and country. It is also possible that the
                song preferences of the person that chose the songs or the availability of lyrics online affected the output of this
                analysis.</p>
            <p>In addition, we looked at subthemes within nouns but chose to display our results using a table instead of a bar chart as with
                the overall song themes. You can reach that page by clicking <a
                    href="subthemeTable.xhtml">here</a> or by clicking the link near the top of
                this page. Again, these results are not determined to be 
                conclusive in a projective sense because of our limited corpus. As expected, when there were a high number of 
                culturally themed nouns in a song, the song tended to be a socially themed
                song. Another idea that this table shows about these songs is that politically
                themed songs have a lot of instances of war themed nouns or just politically themed
                nouns. Religiously themed nouns seem to occur in all different kinds of themes. Of
                the three basic themes, political, social, and regional, a religiously themed noun
                seems to occur equally in each of those overall themes. Nouns that have a love theme seemed to
                occur more in politically social themed songs than in just social songs. This was a
                surprising result, and it would be interesting to see if this result is reproducible or if this
                result was affected by the song choices. One thing to note is that this analysis is not telling of all nouns within songs
                because not all of the songs had nouns that had subthemes, even though
                they had overall themes as songs themselves.</p>
            <p>Since this is such a small data set there is plenty of further work that could be
                done. It is unethical to make projective conclusions based on the results found here but this
                can be used as a stepping stone for further research. </p>
