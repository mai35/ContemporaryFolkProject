                <line>Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river,</line>
                <line>You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her,</line>
                <line>And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you wanna be there,</line>
                <line>And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China,</line>
                <line>And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,</line>
                <line>Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer,</line>
                <line>That you've always been her lover.</line>
            </stanza>

            <stanza>
                <line>And you want to travel with her,</line>
                <line>And you want to travel blind,</line>
                <line>And you know that she will trust you,</line>
                <line>For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.</line>
            </stanza>

            <stanza>
                <line>And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water,</line>
                <line>And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower,</line>
                <line>And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him,</line>
                <line>He said "all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them,"</line>
                <line>But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open</line>
                <line>Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.</line>
            </stanza>

                <line>Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,</line>
                <line>She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,</line>
                <line>And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor,</line>
                <line>And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,</line>
                <line>There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,</line>
                <line>They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,</line>
                <line>While Suzanne holds the mirror.</line>
            </stanza>

            <stanza>
